          Decades ago, Gelman Sciences, a company on the edge of Ann Arbor,
          severely contaminated an aquifer beneath the city with a carcinogenic
          chemical, 1,4-dioxane. Since then, a chemical plume has continued to
          migrate through the city and county, contaminating local lakes and
          private drinking water wells. In the present, the state's consent
          decree that determines how the plume will be managed is showing signs
          that it may not adequately protect wildlife and citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case study explores the question of whether the Ann Arbor city
          council should seek Superfund status for the Gelman site. To some, the
          federal, state and local response to the ecological and public health
          risks has been disappointing. Local advocacy has challenged
          authorities to resolve the issue. Some say designating the site as one
          of the nationâ€™s worst (i.e., a Superfund site) could force a better
          cleanup, while others fear that labeling Ann Arbor as a toxic site
          could bring negative consequences such as decreased property values.

          The plume of dioxane-contaminated water spreading beneath Ann Arbor
          has been called a "slow-motion environmental disaster." In this
          podcast we follow the way in which public outreach and community
          participation have shaped this issue over the years, from its
          discovery in 1984 by Dan Bicknell (a University of Michigan student
          out for a swim) to the present-day debate over whether to pursue
          Superfund status.

            25-part series on the plume
          </a>{' '}
          for The Green Room on WEMU, reflects on the challenge of reporting on
          a dense legal and bureaucratic issue for a public that wants to know
          if its water is safe.
        </p>

          Matthew Naud shares his perspective from a career of dealing with the
          plume as Environmental Coordinator for the City of Ann Arbor, where he
          has seen public concern with the plume wax and wane over the years.

          Detlef Knappe, a Professor at North Carolina State University, helps
          us untangle the mess of dioxane levels and what they mean for human
          health. He studies dioxane contamination in North Carolina, where
          surface water contamination has so far been easier to deal with.
